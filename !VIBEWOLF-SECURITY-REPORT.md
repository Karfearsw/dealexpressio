## 🔍 Detailed Findings

### 🟡 **Medium Risk: Insecure Storage**
**Issue:** Usage of `localStorage` for user identification.
**Location:** `client/src/components/leads/ImportExport.tsx`
```typescript
userId: localStorage.getItem('userId')
```
**Risk:** Relying on `localStorage` for identity claims is insecure if not validated by the backend. While `userId` itself might not be sensitive, this pattern often leads to insecure session management.
**Recommendation:** Use the centralized `AuthContext` to retrieve the authenticated user's ID.
> **VibeWolf Fix:** Switch to `const { user } = useAuth();`

### 🔵 **Info: Hardcoded Credentials (Test Environment)**
**Issue:** Hardcoded password detected in test script.
**Location:** `tools/test_api_endpoints.ts`
```typescript
const TEST_PASSWORD = 'Password123!';
```
**Risk:** **None**. This is a standalone test script not used in production.
**Action:** No action required. Marked as safe.

### 🔵 **Info: HTTP Configuration**
**Issue:** `http://` origins detected in configuration.
**Location:** `server/src/index.ts`, `client/vite.config.ts`
**Risk:** Standard for local development. Ensure these are replaced with `https://` or environment variables in production builds.

## 🛡️ VibeWolf Recommendations

1.  **Dependency Management**: We detected and resolved missing dependencies (`multer`, `csv-parser`) which were causing server instability.
2.  **Authentication**: Refactor `ImportExport.tsx` to use the `useAuth()` hook for cleaner and more secure state management.
